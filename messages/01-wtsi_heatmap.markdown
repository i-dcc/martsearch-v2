**MGP Phenotyping Notice - Please Read**

We are currently in the process of a large update to the way in which we record, handle and display the MGP Phenotyping activities 
at the Sanger Institute. As such, the display of phenotyping data within the **main search interface** is static as of January 2011. 
Please accept our apologies for this delay and any inconvenience it may cause, we shall have the new portal interface up as soon as 
possible.

**Accessing Up-to-date Data**

Although the main search interface for phenotyping data is currently static, we still want make as much up-to-date data as possible 
available. As such:

* The phenotyping counts on the homepage, will represent **up-to-date** information and shall be updated weekly (until the new portal 
  software is ready, then this will be daily).
* Also, a snapshot of the **up-to-date** MGP Phenotyping activities is available as the heatmap download (once again, a weekly update 
  until the new portal software is ready, then this too will be daily) - please refer to this if you would like to see the most 
  up-to-date data we have.
