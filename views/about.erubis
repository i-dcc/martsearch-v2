<h2>About This Portal</h2>
<p>
  This portal is a user-friendly search tool which reads and dynamically 
  re-presents summary data about targeted and trapped mouse knockout 
  availability and structure from a number distinct BioMarts. These 
  BioMarts currently contain: 
  <ul>
    <li>Gene information from MGI</li>
    <li>Knockout information from KOMP, EUCOMM, NorCOMM, Regeneron and TIGM</li>
    <li>Gene expression information from Eurexpress</li>
    <li>Mouse distribution information from EMMA</li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p>
  And shall soon also include (when these datasets become publicly available):
  <ul>
    <li>Phenotyping data from Europhenome</li>
    <li>Gene expression information from GXD</li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p>
  Our motivation arises from our belief that BioMarts are an excellent 
  tool for allowing large datasets to be presented and accessed by 
  computers and expert users.  However, BioMarts need more friendly 
  user search mechanisms and user interfaces for casual users: this 
  portal is one attempt to provide such an interface.  In the process, 
  we believe we have created a portal for the mouse community that can 
  be easily extended to present summarised data as it arises, without 
  extensive re-development.

<h3>How This Portal Works</h3>
<p>
  This portal is powered by software called 
  <a href="http://github.com/dazoakley/martsearchr/">MartSearchr</a>, 
  a server-side client written in Ruby used to pull together data from 
  distributed data sources (housed in Biomarts) into a single unified view.
</p>
<p>
  MartSearchr works by first building an Apache Solr index of all of the 
  available search terms in the cloud of Biomarts (each collection of 
  terms represents a gene).  Here are some diagrams explaining how this is 
  done and the relationships between the data:
  <ul>
    <li>
      <a href="<%= BASE_URI %>/images/about-page/indexing-strategy.png" title="How the Index Is Built" rel="prettyPhoto">How the index is built</a>.
    </li>

      <a href="<%= BASE_URI %>/images/about-page/whats-in-a-doc.png" title="How the Biomarts Are Linked Into the Index" rel="prettyPhoto">How the biomarts are linked into the index</a>.
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p>
  When a user performs a search, the query is first run against the index 
  which returns a paginated list of genes and associated meta data, this 
  meta data is then used to retrieve the information from the cloud of 
  biomarts (data sources) available to the search interface.  A graphical 
  representation of this process is
