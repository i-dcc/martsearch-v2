Welcome to an I-DCC labs test site.  This site is intended as a 
demonstration of how we could go about creating a user-focused 
portal using the Biomarts that we have developed as part of the 
I-DCC project (Portal "Part B").  Please head over to the 
[about page](http://www.idcc.org/labs/idcc_mouse_portal/about) 
for more details on the rationale behind this software.
